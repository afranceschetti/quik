# Quik -  Catch the image

A simple game made with my daughters after playing [Doodle](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobble). 
 
**Play it [here](http://afranceschetti.github.io/quik/)** or use the apps on [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apps24.quik) and [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/it-it/store/games/quikgame/9NBLGGH2R2F5)

No Apple Store, sorry, too expansive for publishing free (and ad-free) apps!!
